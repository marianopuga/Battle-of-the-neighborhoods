Introduction Section :\n\n## Discussion of the business problem and the audience who would be interested in this project.\n### Description of the Problem and Background\n**Scenario:**\n\nI'm currently working in Santiago (Chile, a small country in south america for those who don't know), but I wanna work overseas to get a hold of deeper experiences and develop new abilities. Also, I'm a huge surfing fan so I'd love to combine a city big enough to study an MBA and also stay close to the ocean.   \nThe first place I thought of in order to do this was Dunedin, New Zealand. I want new experiences so I wont compare my current situation (venues I tend to go to for example) to my new prospects but I'd love to find a place with the following amenities:\n\n2-3 bedroom apartment in order to share it\nEasy access to the surf spots.\nDesirable to have venues such as coffee shops, Asian restaurants and gym's\nRent shouldn't be too high, let's say 1200/1500 USD.\n\nBusiness Problem:\nThe challenge is to find a suitable apartment for rent in Dunedin that complies with the demands on location, price and venues. The data required to resolve this challenge is described in the following section 2, below.\n\nInterested Audience\nI'm particulary interested in surfing so I guess this is oriented to those recent graduates that want to explore studying close to the ocean (Otago University has one of the most beatiful campus in the world and is perfect for surfing fans as it's close to some really nice waves!)"
